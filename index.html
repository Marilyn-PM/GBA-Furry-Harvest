  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>This project is a C program that runs on a Game Boy Advance (GBA) emulator. The program demonstrates an understanding of low-level hardware programming in C with GBA devices that are accessed using memory-mapped I/O. Since GBA is a slow computer, optimization tricks (such as DMA) were used to prevent common issues (such as tearing).</p>

  <h1>Design</h1>
  <p>The design for this game was kept simple and on theme. Below is a time lapse video of the design process for the the visual apperance of the game.</p>

  <h1>User Interface</h1>
  <p>The video below shows the different game states the user may encounter while playing the game. These states would be the start screen, game map, and end screen.</p>

  <h1>Functionality</h1>
  <p>Once the program is successfully run, you will start on the initial start screen with an animation. When you click Start/Enter the game begins with a 45-second countdown. Using the Up/Down and Right/Left arrow keys you must navigate the bunny around the map to collect as many carrots as possible (There are at most 8 carrots on the screen at all times). Once your time is up it will take you to the final screen, where you will get a summary of your results. At any moment during the game clicking the Select/Backspace button will take you back to the home screen, this will reset stats and the entire program. </p>
